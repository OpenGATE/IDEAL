=========================
API configuration file
=========================

To be able to use the IDEAL API interface, the user must customize the ``api.cfg`` file, in the ``cfg`` folder.
The file has two main sections:

----------
[receiver]
----------

``send result``
	true or false. If true, the log_daemon will attempt to send the results back. This assumes that there is a 'receiving' API running on the client.
    an example of such an API can be found in ``receiver_test.py`` in the IDEAL's main directory.
``url to send result``
	e.g. http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/results
``url authentication``
	e.g. http://127.0.0.1:3000/auth. The API uses login data.

--------
[server]
--------

``IP host``
	IP address of the server
``credentials db``
	.db file containing the authorized users login data and information.
``ssl cert`` 
	path to the ssl certificate, if needed
``ssl key``
	path to the ssl key, if needed


The API runs by default on the https protocol. Therefore, a self signed certificate and related key should be generated. 
The API can also run on http, with small modifications to the ``bin/api.py`` file. In this case, the ssl certificate and key are not needed. 
For more info, read the dedicated section on the user manual.
